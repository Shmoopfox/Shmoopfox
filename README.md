Hello there! I'm Shmoopfox, a passionate hardware developer with a focus on analog computer systems. 
I started my journey in this field in 2021 and have been developing hardware for analog computer 
systems ever since.

Currently, I'm deeply involved in a series of analog computers called Upstream. This project is a 
testament to my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in analog computing.

If you're interested in discussing analog computing, hardware development, or any other topic, 
feel free to reach out to me at elijah.paxx@proton.me. I'm always open to new connections and 
collaborations.
